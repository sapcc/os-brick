    Dell EMC VxFlex OS driver: This release corrects an issue where the
    fix for `Bug #1823200 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1823200>`_
    did not run correctly when using Python 2.7.  If you are interested
    in this release because of `OSSN-0086
    <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0086>`_, be aware that
    you must also deploy a configuration file on compute nodes, cinder
    nodes, and anywhere you would perform a volume attachment in your
    deployment.  Please see the release notes for the previous release
    for details.

    This release corrects a problem with the fix for `Bug #1823200
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1823200>`_ in the previous
    release.  If you are running OpenStack on Python 3, you should not
    be impacted by this bug.  If you are not using Dell EMC VxFlex OS
    (ScaleIO) Storage as a backend for Cinder, you do not need to upgrade
    to this release.

    `Bug #1883654 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/os-brick/+bug/1883654>`_:
    The fix for `Bug #1823200
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1823200>`_ in the previous
    release used a Python 3-specific language feature and thus did not
    run correctly when used with Python 2.7.  The problem has been corrected
    in this release.
